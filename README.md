# codeforces-scraper

**EDIT:** Turns on you can use codeforces API to get data instead of scraping each page, example: http://codeforces.com/api/contest.status?contestId=282&from=1&count=10000

Given the problem number, problem letter and specified programming language, this script will scrape codeforces.com for all of the accepted solutions to that problem and write them to a CSV file.

##To-Do
- Specify problem at command line instead of hard coding
- Option to scrape unaccepted submissions 
- Allow for scraping of multiple problems at once for a single language
- Abiltiy to scrape one problem in multiple languages at the same time
